		Pam Carter's Scriptural Poetry
	</h1>
</header>
<div class="readable_width">
<p>For many years, my grandmother has been writing poems. Upon seeing my work, she requested that I compile them into a proper, professionally printed book.</p>
<p>Using InDesign, I sifted through over 20 years of word documents, photographs, and treasured fragments to create something that would do her poems justice. The layout and styling also incorporate a personal touch, as it was created for someone whom I love very much.</p>
<p>Beyond creating something that honoured my grandmotherâ€™s dedication to poetry, it also proved an excellent opportunity to broaden my knowledge of designing for press and physical mediums, and I gained a lot of knowledge doing it.</p>
