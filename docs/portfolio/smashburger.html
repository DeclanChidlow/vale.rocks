		Smash Burger
	</h1>
</header>
<p>I must say, I'm quite the fan of a good burger, so when I got the brief while completing my Certificate IV in Graphic Design to brand a fictional foodtruck by the name of Smash Burger, I wanted to do it justice.</p>
<p>The brief specified that they were targeting 16 to 25 year olds looking for great burgers and that they needed to stand out among the crowd at events.</p>
<p>Naturally, I designed their logo with big, bold typography that stands out from the background. I followed that up with an impactful red and yellow colour palette to be adorned on every surface. This really helped it stand out and cement its own identity.</p>
<p>With the brand defined, I moved on to designing a range of touchpoints, such as the packaging and the design of the truck itself. I think the final product really cemented a strong identity and fulfilled the brief to its fullest extent.</p>
