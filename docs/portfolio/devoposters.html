		Devo Posters

</header>
<p>Devo is a band I've been a fan of ever since I was very young. Dancing along to &quot;Whip It!&quot; on my MP3 player, hearing their scores for films and games, and seeing Mark Mothersbaugh on Yo Gabba Gabba are all etched into my brain.</p>
<p>When I was tasked with making a set of posters for a band of my choosing while studying for my Cert IV in Graphic Design, it was a no brainer to choose them. Their distinct style and captivating visuals offered the perfect canvas to showcase my skills and pay homage to a band that has been a significant inspiration.</p>
<p>The brief was to create three posters, each taking inspiration from the colours and styles of a specific decade. I chose to represent the 1920s, 1960s, and 2000s. I researched each era and built up a palette for my posters.</p>
<p>For my 1920s poster, I selected the era's more muted, warmer colours, tapping into the sepia toned elegance of the past. My geometric, stylized silhouettes attempted to echo the modernist approach of the time.</p>
<p>In contrast, my 1960s poster leaned into more psychedelic, vivid colours, capturing the free-spirited essence of the era. The palette and overall design take much inspiration from Arnold Skolnick's 1969 Woodstock poster.</p>
<p>My 2000s design was perhaps the most open in terms of palette. Being the era where digital technologies really took hold, there was a full digital palette at my disposal. I chose the bright, sometimes garish, colour palettes of the Frutiger Metro aesthetic.</p>
<p>With each poster, I made an earnest attempt to not only capture the colours but also celebrate the artistic evolution and technological advancements that defined each period.</p>
