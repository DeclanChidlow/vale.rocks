We're past any pretence or keeping up of appearances now. The United States of America is invading foreign countries, overthrowing leaders, and threatening what were previously allies, all while disappearing and murdering its own citizens. This has been the case for months, but it seems we've reached a tipping point in recent days.

Given that it is unclear if there will even be another election, I think it can be said without hyperbole that the United States is now a dictatorship until proven otherwise.

Things are really bad. I don't know if it is worse that it is happening or worse that there are so many human people willingly making it happen.
