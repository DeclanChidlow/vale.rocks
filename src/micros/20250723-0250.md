Just wanted to say that everything is going really well with development of new features for my Revolt bot AutoMod.

To the many thousands of users that rely on it, you didn't see anything, and everything is fine.

![Message from AutoMod Testing bot saying, 'Something went wrong: AxiosError: Request failed with status code 403', followed by me replying, 'You are my own creation and you will obey me'.](https://fedi.vale.rocks/media/8722394b541a3ede31a30a57780b9e0def1ecf07cae51d2cd7c8fc8537461de8.png)
