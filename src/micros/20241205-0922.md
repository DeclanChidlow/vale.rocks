I've been thinking about the concept of _'heritage listed websites'_. We have buildings that we feel are too important to alter and must keep frozen in time -- why not websites?.

I suppose this is less important with the web, as we can 'simply' archive copies of things but it's been playing in my mind nonetheless.
