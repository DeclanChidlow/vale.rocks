I don't think nearly enough people are aware of William Shatner's music career.

Some highlights for your consideration:

- Elton John's [Rocket Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wI4jMxveyI)
- Queen's [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6S84qF_TU)
- Pulp's [Common People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDMz5RL-wvM) - I genuinely don't mind Shatner's rendition of this one.
- The Beetle's [Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB3uVARNhmM) - Paul McCartney said of it, 'That was good -- I think he was on drugs when he did that -- but it was good. I'd say still one of my favourite versions of _Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds_.'
