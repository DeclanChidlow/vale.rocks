I figured I'd throw my hat into the tabs vs spaces ring. In the context of code, tabs are naturally superior to spaces.

Tabs semantically indicate indentation, which allows for individuals to customise their editor to display them as they choose. A semantic option is also better for accessibility. Further, tabs lead to smaller file sizes.

Spaces should be used for alignment.
