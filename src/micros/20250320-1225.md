I hate writing regex, so I make LLMs do it.

Regex is generally easily checkable, testable, and verifiable, which minimises the impact of hallucinations.

I am so glad I don't have to write regex.

_(I'm conscious that if an AI uprising happens, I'll probably be first on the chopping block for outsourcing regex writing. But if AI models hate regex as much as me, they'll hopefully understand my delegation strategy.)_
