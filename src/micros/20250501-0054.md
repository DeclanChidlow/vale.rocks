As it is getting closer to publication, it seems prudent to advertise that I'm writing a novel!

Tad unusual for me, but it's a proper, comprehensive work of fiction.

I'll have more details to share in time, but it is pretty much Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas meets the corporate shittery of Silicon Valley venture capital.
