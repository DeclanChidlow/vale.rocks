Writing with proper grammar is a curse online because it makes people feel entitled to offer all sorts of unsolicited corrections.

Many people write in phone shorthand, littered with spelling mistakes and without any punctuation, without having anyone pull them up on it.

But because I generally write with correct spelling and grammar, Iâ€™ll have multiple people harassing me when I slip up.
