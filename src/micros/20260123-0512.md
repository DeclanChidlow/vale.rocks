I love when websites with completely static content crash.

Congrats! Instead of making a static site, you made a static dynamic site. None of the benefits of a static site but all of the downsides of a dynamic site. What's the point?

I really just can't understand the mindset.

Someone commented on how snappy [TechConf.Directory](https://techconf.directory) is. That's due to the site just being HTML/CSS/JS/JSON generated at build time. No client-side third-party dependencies.

Even on the development side, the only dependency is Web Origami, which is just used for populating templates and manipulating data

Once again, the winning formula is to bet on the web platform and not needlessly overcomplicate things.
