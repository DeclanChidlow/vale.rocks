Today I launched a new blog for my Revolt bot AutoMod! Given the many thousands of users that rely on the bot, I decided that a central location for news, updates, technical details, and general information was necessary.

I'm really pleased with how it turned out visually, though I'm sure I'll be tweaking and refining it for the rest of eternity. The rainbow mesh gradient behind the header came out particularly nicely, in my opinion.

Underneath that is the text of an article.](https://fedi.vale.rocks/media/8fc65eb54ecc2f4271c82945aac3bdcb83c3deca1bc9d5847f16a9041a76942b.avif)
