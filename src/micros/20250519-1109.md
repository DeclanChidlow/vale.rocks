YOLO (You Only Live Once) is just as much justification not to do something as it is to do something, yet it is rarely treated as such.

Tangentially, you don't hear YOLO as a phrase very often anymore. Maybe those YOLOers with gung-ho inclinations wiped themselves out and took the phrase with them?
