<abbr>YOLO</abbr> (You Only Live Once) is just as much justification not to do something as it is to do something, yet it is rarely treated as such.

Tangentially, you don't hear <abbr>YOLO</abbr> as a phrase very often anymore. Maybe those <abbr>YOLO</abbr>ers with gung-ho inclinations wiped themselves out and took the phrase with them?
