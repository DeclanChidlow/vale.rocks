Blimey, I'm lovin' `<dialog>` and the Popover API. JavaScript free\* menus without the need for any hacks.

I used to use some trickery involving CSS's `:target` to implement menus...

This is only gonna get cooler when anchor positioning gets more comprehensive support. Top layer elements and anchor positioning go together like butter and toast.
