This holiday season I've been enjoying the collection of Kmart in-store cassette tapes stored by the Internet Archive.

You should be able to find them simply by searching "Kmart December" on [archive.org](https://archive.org).

Might play them on Christmas day for the family. Assuming they don't pin me down and turn it off...
