Part of my diploma at North Metropolitan TAFE was a live-works project redeveloping the website for Public Libraries WA.

My team and I took what was an outdated Joomla site and revitalised it into a sleek, modern experience. The old site was built back in 2009, had security flaws and lacked responsive design, rendering it nigh unusable on mobile devices.

We rebuilt it from the ground up using WordPress paired with a custom theme built using Tailwind and a tailor-made plugin to perfectly fit our client's needs.

It was awesome working with [Emily Drage](https://emilydrage.com), [Zoe Chan](https://zoecchan.me), and Maria Benic on this.

In the centre of the page is the text "Public Libraries WA" with the subtitle "Inspiring Minds". Behind it is a warm picture of the outside of a modern looking library building. 
At the very bottom of the page are some statistics that are cut off.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEPOgaprKm4Pg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1733356822327?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=h0XqVSa6kjrK_nD8MjVQIHHnnNy8wtGAmxX3-qV-4cg)
