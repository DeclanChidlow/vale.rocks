Prompted by David Bushell testing how his website fared when run through automated translators, I did the same.

It isn't perfect, but Vale.Rocks now adapts nicely for people reading in languages that read right-to-left. It feels a tad bizarre seeing the UI flipped, given how intricately familiar I am with it.

You can give it a whirl with a right-to-left language like Arabic in Kagi Translate.

_(Also, I'd quite appreciate a logical version of CSS' translate.)_
