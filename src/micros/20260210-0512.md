In our moderation panel over at [Stoat](https://stoat.chat), we have a button to deploy bees.

We don't want to have to deploy bees, but sometimes that is the only viable option. Releasing bees as a moderation action is always a difficult call to make, but sometimes bees are the only tool for the job.

![Vale's user inspected in the internal Stoat admin panel. There are actions including 'Suspend', 'Ban', 'Wipe Messages', and 'Bees'.](https://fedi.vale.rocks/media/d145f641d3350c10994968b3f627363b9f34bf85a11acf485fd3eb6f20472675.avif)

We have strict policies in place regarding bee usage. As it is, of course, a destructive action, we do also have a confirmation modal to avoid accidental bee deployments.

![Modal reading 'Release the bees. Are you sure you want to send the bees?'. The two options are 'Cancel' and 'Deploy'.](https://fedi.vale.rocks/media/ab9010c035f7d42c229b821088ae08e07f52cef4c75fac1a98298964f2552364.avif)
