The modern job searching experience:

Job Title: Entry Level Position  
Requirements: 3 to 5 years of experience

How does somebody get experience when nobody will hire them because they don't have experience?

And don't forget the job description:

Our company operates like a family, where collaboration, innovation, and a sense of belonging are central to our success.
