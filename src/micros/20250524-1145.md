Carousels are a web staple. Websites use them, and thus people do in turn. They've garnered a _lot_ of hate over the years, primarily due to being largely inaccessible and poor ways of presenting information, yet still they persist. So, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

The Chrome team put together [Carousels with CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/carousels-with-css) which Sara Soueidan has [examined in extreme depth](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-carousels-accessibility). My main takeaway from the main article and Sara's analysis is that while this is a vague step in the correct direction, it doesn't address any of the core issues [like accessibility](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/my-request-to-google-on-accessibility.html) and introduces new ones. I was disappointed to see the approach taken in regard to [addressing those issues](https://bsky.app/profile/nerdy.dev/post/3lprmlrziwc2h) and think Eric Eggert [hit the nail on the head](https://bsky.app/profile/yatil.net/post/3lpvdvuvjuk2d).

It completely fails with regard to separation of concerns by using CSS for structure, rather than HTML. I don't know how to address that other than asking _why?_ I've noticed a lot of new CSS features, especially ones with the Chrome team's influence, are getting a little too markup-y for my liking. David Bushell has [covered this and the overreliance of pseudo-elements](https://dbushell.com/2025/05/23/pseudo-elements/) with touchings on the [carousel kerfuffle](https://dbushell.com/notes/2025-05-07T09:51Z/).

HTML is for structure, CSS is for styling, JS is for anything that can't be achieved with HTML/CSS, and accessibility isn't omittable. We should be striving to build a web that is both functional and inclusive. Respect the web; respect users.
