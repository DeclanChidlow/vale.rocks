Lost my pet chicken of 8 years today. She was with me from primary school all the way through high school and beyond.

She hasn’t been well these past few days. Today when I came out to see her, she really wasn’t well but was still hanging on. I think she was waiting for me to see her before she went.

I picked her up and cradled her for a while before she passed in my arms. There is a bit of comfort knowing I was with her in her last moments and that she wasn’t alone.

I’ll miss you Garbin. Love you.
