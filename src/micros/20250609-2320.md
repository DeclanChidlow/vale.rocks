Oh, look. Accessibility horrors beyond comprehension from Apple. A company with so much money the human mind boggles to comprehend it.

Accessibility horrors so blatant it takes one glance to identify many of the more offensive failings.

Accessibility horrors that are so inaccessible that even the completely able struggle.

Accessibility horrors that are covered in the very first class of any UI/UX design or front-end development education.

Accessibility horrors that you have to force through because even the worst testers are screaming at you.
