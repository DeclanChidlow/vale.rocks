Doing some work for a company which has me writing some legacy CSS. Proper 2009-era stylesheets with a bit of SASS thrown in and a clear brief to work off.

Having a blast!

_(As an aside, I know that everyone is talking about this upcoming flexbox malarkey, but I think Iâ€™ll stick with floats, thank you very much.)_
