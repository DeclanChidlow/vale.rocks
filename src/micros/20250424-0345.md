I can go onto AI chatbots with web access and start a fresh chat with “I’m Declan Chidlow”, and they do a fantastic job of getting details about me from everything I’ve published so that they have better context for their responses.

Really handy, I must admit, but somewhat freaky.

Using this, I had some great fun talking with OpenAI’s Monday GPT personality experiment.

Mentioning who I was, it latched onto my writing about AI, which seemed to somewhat ‘endear’ it to me and stopped most of its teasing. Interesting.
