I went to a bank and put a really high negative margin on all the money inside. This offset was enough for it to appear outside the bank, allowing me to abscond with it.

Of course, banks can easily avoid this situation by applying `overflow: hidden` to their vaults, but they very rarely remember to. It tends to be an operational oversight.
