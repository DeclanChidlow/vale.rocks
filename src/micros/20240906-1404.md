Genuine exchange I just had:

> Person: It's broken on mobile.
>
> _Me: Do you have a Samsung by chance?_
>
> Person: Yes, I have
>
> _Me: Do you use Samsung Internet?_
>
> Person: I'm not sure what that is. I use the default browser.
>
> _Me: I shall refrain from using the selection of words I'd like to._

Seriously, how is Samsung Internet still this much of a clusterfuck?
