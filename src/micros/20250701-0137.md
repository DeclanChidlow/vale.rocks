Some write on LinkedIn, \
A corporate stage, \
With line breaks and stanzas, \
Performing wisdom for wage.

Though prose might suffice, \
For their thoughts to engage, \
They craft it with short lines, \
For reach at each stage.

Is this engaging? \
Or just pretence? \
Poetry on LinkedInâ€“ \
Lacking in sense.
