I was working with [Three.js](https://threejs.org) today, and I noticed they've got a navigation item called 'GPT' in the sidebar of their site.

Clicking it takes you to a ChatGPT GPT called '[Three.js Mentor](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-jGjqAMvED-three-js-mentor)'. First time I've seen something like this. Feels odd.
