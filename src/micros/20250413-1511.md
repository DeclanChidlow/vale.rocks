I read the My Little Pony fan fiction Friendship is Optimal the other day, and my mind has been mulling over the [teletransportation paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox) since.

It has irked me for years, but now it is brought back to the forefront of my mind. It really bugs me that I have no definitive answer.

I'm inclined to say it is death and a clone rather than just transportation.

However, I also think that the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) is still the same ship even when none of the original remains.

I'm not sure where I draw the line. Time, and continuity versus duplication, I suppose.
