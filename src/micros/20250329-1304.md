I've been making improvements to Vale.Rocks using [Polypane's](https://polypane.app) suggestions, which pick up things standard browser dev tools miss.

Also, Portal is awesome for testing across devices.

Polypane also has a celebration button that appears when I fix all accessibility issues, which is an absolute joy.

I have a few minor niggles, but on the whole I'm really liking Polypane.

Regarding those niggles, [Kilian Valkhof](https://kilianvalkhof.com) is absolutely fantastic and extremely receptive to feedback, which is wonderful.
