Thank you to [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li) for using plain, user-readable links for collecting analytics in [The Index](https://piccalil.li/the-index/).

There are so many newsletters with tracking links so obfuscated that it is difficult to gauge the actual destination.

Piccalilli's approach should be the standard, not an exception.
