HAPPY NEW YEAR!
 
My plan for 2025 is to put out more everything and focus on what sticks. The goal is to experiment, learn, and double down on what works.
 
2024 has very much been a year of general experimentation and exploration for me. Now I want to start testing things more aligned with my goals and putting the knowledge I gain to use!
