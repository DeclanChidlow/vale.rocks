Micro-blogging platforms like Bluesky and Fedi are built around following people, not topics. This is good in that I can create meaningful connections with familiar faces, but bad in that I pass up great content because I can't just follow the parts of people's feeds that interest me.

Sometimes I wish I could follow someone's tech posts without their politics, or their design without their hot takes. If you're wondering why I don't follow you, it's probably because of this. I still love ya!

(I've come to find this is somewhat doable via word filtering, although it is a bit finicky, not comprehensive, and introduces potential for false positives. I'll trial it and see how it goes.)
