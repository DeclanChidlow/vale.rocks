My Stoat bot AutoMod had a major outage that I've spent several hours working to fix. It has eaten half my weekend and been quite the ordeal.

Just now it has started working perfectly again. It is fixed, but I have no idea what broke in the first place nor what fixed it.

There is no code difference between the working and non-working versions. The most awful solution to a problem is one that happens out of chance and for reasons unknown.

The onset seemed to be related to having some 180K users, 64K channels, and 6K servers cached.
