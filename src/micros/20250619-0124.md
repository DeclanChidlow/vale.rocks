I am unfortunately seeing a lot of stylised text on social media. They are horribly inaccessible. Don't use them!

These aren't actual fonts, merely a collection of Unicode characters.

For example, a screen reader will read 𝐁𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭 as: 'Mathematical Bold Capital B Mathematical Bold Small O Mathematical Bold Small L Mathematical Bold Small D Mathematical Bold Capital T Mathematical Bold Small E Mathematical Bold Small X Mathematical Bold Small T'.

This isn't an issue with screen readers -- they're performing exactly as they should. This is an issue with people misusing these characters.

If you need it phrased in a business sense, by excluding so many people who are trying to read what you're writing, you're limiting your reach and hurting your growth.
