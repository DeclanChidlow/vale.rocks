I misinput a value in one of [my recent articles](/posts/my-experience-biohacking), so it stated the post was revised in February rather than January.

Out of the thousands of viewers, only one person caught it and pointed this out to me.

It is so important to get fresh eyes on things and to seek feedback.

Remember: For every person who reports an issue, there are likely dozens or hundreds (or even thousands) who noticed but stayed quiet.
