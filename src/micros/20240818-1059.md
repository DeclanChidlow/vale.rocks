This is a quote from Gian-Carlo Rota's _Indiscrete Thoughts_ that I think applies particularly well in the context of development:

> Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: _"How did he do it? He must be a genius!_"
