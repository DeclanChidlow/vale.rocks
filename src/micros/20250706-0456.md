I'm sick currently, and I wish to advise against watching The Twilight Zone whilst in a state similar to mine, for it will penetrate your fever dreams and take you to a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind; a journey into an incoherent land whose boundaries are that of imagination.

(Watching Neon Genesis Evangelion instead was not the best call I've made.)
