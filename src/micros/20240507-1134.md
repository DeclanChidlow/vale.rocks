Well, I just watched _Red vs Blue: Restoration_. I suppose that's it. Red vs Blue is over. I was late to the series, having only discovered it in recent years, but that doesn't make seeing it end any easier.

Restoration felt rushed and unpolished. I think an extra half hour on it's runtime would have it many favours. It certainly wasn't the best ending, but it was an ending, and that's something.

It's sad to see things end but I think it's important to simply value the memories they created. After all, memory is the key

Thanks Rooster Teeth.
