My caffeine tolerance is already extremely low thanks to my self-imposed restriction of only actively consuming caffeine a maximum of three times a week. For reference, one cup of coffee past noon will keep me awake into the early morning. A cup of tea past ~15:00 will have a noticeable impact on my ability to fall asleep.

My caffeine consumption the past two weeks has been very low. For reference, [about two weeks](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15448977/) without any caffeine is about how long it takes for tolerance to be lost.

Yesterday I had a cup of tea followed by an instant coffee (tea first for the possible benefits of theanine). I was jittering, my mind felt sharp, I was honed in, and I felt overheated. I've never had such a strong effect from caffeine before. Even with my low intake and care taken not to consume too much, I must have had a tolerance built up.
