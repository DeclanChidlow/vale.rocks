Y'know, when I started getting into development proper, I read so many blog posts and publications from fantastic people.

If you'd told me as a youngster that as a 19-year-old I'd be writing for these publications and chatting with figures whose work I admired, I simply wouldn't have believed you.

I know you should â€˜never meet your heroes', but I'm ecstatic to get to meet so many of my inspirations.

There are a lot of fields out there, and I'm so glad I found myself doing web/front-end development. I can scarcely think of communities so kind and open to sharing knowledge.

Thank you to all.
