I've spent far longer than I wish to admit getting the Domino's App feat Hatsune Miku working on my iPad 4, but I finally managed it today.

I initially went about it a stupidly complex way but ended up learning quite a bit along the way, so it wasn't a total waste of time.

It seems some people have looked into decompiling it to fix the frequent crashes and broken features. Hopefully, this becomes a reality.
