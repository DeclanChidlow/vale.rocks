Google has a secret ‘Forums’ tab that exclusively returns results from forums and discussion boards. You just need to append the query “udm=18” to the URL.

e.g <https://www.google.com/search?q=JPEG+XL&udm=18>

Further, and as you're likely aware, you can use "utm=14" for a simpler set of results devoid of cruft such as knowledge panels and AI slop. It is reminiscent of the Google of old.
