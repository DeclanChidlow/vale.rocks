Speakers of English (traditional) rejoice, for I have fixed CSS. You can sleep easy knowing that there exists an easy way to permit writing 'colour' as 'colour'.

BritCSS is a simple bit of client-side JS that permits using English spellings.

Always fun to put together small things like this because I inevitably learn something I didn't know.
