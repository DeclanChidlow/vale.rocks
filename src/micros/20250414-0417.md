I generally dislike that I cannot edit posts on Bluesky, but I do appreciate that something can't be switched out or altered to have different meaning when reposting or replying.

I've had people do this with malicious intent, such as a bait and switch, or after I've written extensive analysis.

The inability to edit has also inclined me to post ephemerally and accept that content will age with time.

This is something I avoid to the extent possible in my long-form content on Vale.Rocks.
