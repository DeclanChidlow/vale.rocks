I see many social media posts including emojis and hashtags in sentences. This is inaccessible!

Screen readers read things out, and that includes your emojis.

For example, 'I drink tea 🍵 from my teapot 🫖 to relax.' might be read aloud as 'I drink tea teacup without handle emoji from my teapot teapot emoji to relax.'

That is confusing and difficult to understand.

Instead, keep emojis to the start or end of your sentences. Like this: 'I drink tea from my teapot to relax. 🫖'

Remember, the more accessible your posts are, the more people they can reach, which helps growth.

Hashtags are treated similarly but are also generally distracting mid-sentence. They're best put at the end of posts.
