Finally gave Zed a quick go on NixOS. It's slick. The collaboration features are unrivalled.

If someone asks for a code editor in future, Zed is gonna be my suggestion. As much as I love NeoVim, I understand it isn't everyone's cup of tea. I can only see Zed getting better and filling the shoes of VS Code.
