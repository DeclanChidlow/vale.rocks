Popped over to SpaceHey to check out discussion of an early 2000s indie musical project, and I loaded a Windows 3.1 Hot Dog Stand-themed group where [the first account I saw](https://spacehey.com/sigmundfreud) had a profile picture with the text 'this man ate my son' below a photo of David Dixon's Ford Prefect.

The web isn't all bad.
