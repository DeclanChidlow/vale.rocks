_(To the tune of ABBA's Money, Money, Money)_

I write all night, I write all day, to craft the guides they toss away. \
Ain't it sad? \
But praise is cheap and tickets close, for all this thankless, perfect prose. \
That's too bad.

A new feature ships, all sleek and grand, \
But no one seems to understand. \
I wouldn't be writing docs at all; \
I'd fool around and have a ball.
