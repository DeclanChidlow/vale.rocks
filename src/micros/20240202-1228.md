I've been playing Mario Kart Wii half the day. I got rather violently Mario Karted by the bots on Koopa Cape a minute ago. From 1st to 12th in the blink of an eye. Oh well.

I'm playing with no bloom or background blurring in HD on my rather large TV with an Xbox controller. Of course, this wouldn't be possible without the excellent [Dolphin emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org). A huge thanks to all who have contributed to emulation.
