I love the process of creating and refining things to perfection!

1. Build something.
2. Put it out there.
3. Observe how it’s received and gather feedback.
4. Identify, plan, and enact action to improve it.
5. Repeat until it’s as close to perfection as possible!

The OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop is a powerful framework—not just for decision-making, but for building better products and experiences.

It's also invaluable in avoiding wasting time building things that nobody wants or needs.
