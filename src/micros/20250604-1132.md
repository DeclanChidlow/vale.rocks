And with a single click, I find myself transported to an ancient place. I'm a digital archaeologist, and I've stumbled across a long-forgotten remnant of those who came before. UI untouched for a decade.

It is two rebrands old. The palette is warped. Distorted. There are gradients. Buttons forged from a low-resolution image. I brush away a drop-shadow-lg.png to inspect an input form. Picking it up, I bring it to my face to count the pixels, only to be hit by the harsh aroma of Bootstrap 2 in the back of my throat.

I drop it to the ground, and it shatters into CSS properties. "Oh well," I muse aloud. "It'll be fixed on refresh. Assuming anyone ever discovers this place again."

I do what I came to do and close the tab.
