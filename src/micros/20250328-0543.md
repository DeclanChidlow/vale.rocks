People keep talking about AI-generated imagery as something that is _going to be_ really bad. Or that it is _going to be_ indistinguishable from real photos.

I don't think people realise we passed that point quite a while ago.

The 'tells' are already gone; there is just a lot of stuff still releasing generated with lesser models that people _do_ happen to notice -- it is almost a redirection of sorts.
