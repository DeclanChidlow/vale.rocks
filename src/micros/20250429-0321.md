I've been testing the new Qwen3 today. I don't have the compute for the higher parameter models, but I've been having a lot of fun with 0.6b.

It is such a derpy little model.

Here is a thinking extract I found rather humorous:

> Okay, the user said, "Hi Qwen. Nice shoes." Let me think about how to respond.
>
> First, the user greeted me with a friendly "Hi" and complimented my shoes. I need to acknowledge their compliment politely.
>
> Since I'm an AI, I don't have shoes, so I should explain that. Maybe say something like, "Hi there! I don't have shoes."
