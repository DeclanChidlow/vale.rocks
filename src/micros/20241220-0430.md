My article on HTML's legacy colour parsing was featured on Manuel MatuzoviÄ‡'s HTMHell today. ðŸŽ‰

For those unfamiliar, the HTMHell Advent Calendar is a fantastic publication bringing together authors from around the world to share insightful articles on web development topics like security, accessibility, UX, and performance.

In my article, I dive into the quirks of HTML's legacy colour parsing, exploring just why the value 'chucknorris' outputs red and talk about the resilience of the web.
