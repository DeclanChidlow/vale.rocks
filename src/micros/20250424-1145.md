Naturally, I generally dislike government censorship. That said, I think Bluesky's approach to it seems to be relatively decent comparative to other, more mainstream platforms.

Bluesky has a global general moderation system with finer-grained moderation rules based on the law and requests of given jurisdictions. Resisting censorship completely is only going to get the entire platform banned in whatever jurisdiction, which obviously isn't in Bluesky's best interests and is arguably worse for the platform overall.

At the very least somebody so inclined can skirt around the country-specific moderation thanks to the openness of the AT Proto. It isn't a perfect approach, but I think it is generally better than the standard and a reasonable compromise.
