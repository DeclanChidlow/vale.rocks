Trans Rights are Human Rights.

That is a fact and not something that is up for debate. Yet, LinkedIn, through omission, has deemed it acceptable to degrade transgender individuals on the platform.

They have updated their community guidelines to remove 'Misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals' as an example of hateful and derogatory content.

They also removed 'like race or gender identity' from 'Content that negatively targets others on the basis of inherent traits, like race or gender identity, is enforced under our Hateful and Derogatory Content policies.'

This is not something that occurs as a mistake â€“ they have made the deliberate and intentional decision to remove this language from their policies.

And no, to head it off at the pass, trying to appease a corrupt government is not valid justification for loosening protections.

Open Terms Archive, who diligently observe and record changes made to platform policies and report on them, have explained the changes in further detail: <https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedin-removes-transgender-hate-speech-protections/>
