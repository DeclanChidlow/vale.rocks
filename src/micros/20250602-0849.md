I’ve been CAPTCHA’d. They’re holding me at a data centre and won’t let me go until I point out all the motorcycles, but they keep telling me I’m incorrect. Please send help! The situation is dire.

![Note with text distorted like a CAPTCHA reading: 'I'm still stuck here. I feel insanity creeping in. I swear I clicked all of the motorcycles. Do the little bits in the corners count? I'm starting to think they just like the sound of my panicked keyboard clicks. Please help me. I beg of you.'](https://fedi.vale.rocks/media/1e54b3c98d3df4a153d3ede508f32fae4ce113bb154ed1052eb493228442de8a.png)

The hand is going beyond the borders of the image box and covering portions of the UI.](https://fedi.vale.rocks/media/db8623f7ae2620bbf78847c2a1c7924100470eccdf6c44d68090e492e56b4c82.png)
