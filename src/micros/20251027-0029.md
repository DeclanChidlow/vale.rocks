SEO is not a game of absolutes, and anyone who acts to the contrary is dubious at best.

Search engine optimisation is extremely complex. By design, nobody has a completely full and comprehensive understanding of search engine ranking -- not even the people working at those search engines. This is intentional and done to prevent exploiting the system.

The same is true for Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) or Artificial Intelligence Optimisation (AIO), but to an ever greater extent. LLMs are so complex and trained on so much data that they regularly do things unprompted and act in ways uninstructed. As it stands, even someone who knew all about the functionality of the models would be unable to speak in absolutes.

I'm not saying that SEO folk are scammers or conspicuous (though some are), but SEO/GEO/AIO experts who speak with complete certainty and in absolutes are doing so from a place of sales, not truth.
