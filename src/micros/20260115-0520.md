Living in the world’s most isolated city, looking at front-end conference prices, plus the price for several connecting flights spanning multiple days of travel, plus accommodation and expenses...

Yikes.

I think the only way it'd be viable is if I can string a few together and attend a few at once.

I don't suppose anyone has collated a list of good front-end or web conferences worth attending somewhere? Ideally with information such as dates and ticket prices.
