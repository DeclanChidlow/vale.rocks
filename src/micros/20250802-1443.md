I get rather hateful emails quite often. Usually due to my writing.

One of these emails referred to me as an 'AI-loving, hypergraphia-addled, graphomaniacal, logorrheic schizophrenic'.

Hateful intent aside, that is genuinely the best insult I've ever received. I can picture someone sprawled over a thesaurus cackling to themselves while pursuing the perfect selection of words -- refining their diction with obsessive glee and hitting send with a maniacal laugh.
