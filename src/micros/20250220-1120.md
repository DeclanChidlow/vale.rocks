My magnet implant is super sensitive at the moment. I can feel the magnets in my laptop chassis as I type this.

Wonder what is causing it and if it is permanent.

This is really wack. It is so much more sensitive. I can easily sense a field from double the distance I could yesterday.

I've palpated the area and can't feel any physical difference. Really odd.
