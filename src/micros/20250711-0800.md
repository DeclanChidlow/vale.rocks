[Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer Productivity](https://metr.org/Early_2025_AI_Experienced_OS_Devs_Study.pdf) <sub>(Joel Becker, Nate Rush, Beth Barnes, David Rein)</sub> released with the observation that completion time of PRs is 19% longer when using AI, but that developers think that it reduced completion time by 20%.

A few notes from me:

- This is on large-scale, mature repositories and conducted with maintainers intricately familiar. It is mentioned in the paper <sub>(C.1.2)</sub> that 'developers note that AI is much less helpful on issues where they are expert.' It is also mentioned that 'LLM tooling performs worse in more complex environments.' <sub>(C.1.3)</sub>.
- They were provided with web interfaces or Cursor Pro but usually opted for the latter. In some cases this differed from their usual tooling, and I personally find this an [annoying and unproductive way to code](/posts/ai-usage#coding).
- Being in a study, developers may have felt pressure to use AI in situations that would otherwise be unnecessary.
- I would be interested in a similar study where developers are put in smaller repositories they aren't familiar with.

Super interesting paper, and I look forward to future studies and whatever further findings come from it. I don't look forward to seeing the discourse as AI advocates dismiss these results and AI haters take them at face value, despite the paper's cautioning against overgeneralising.
