Many people agree that 'artificial intelligence' is a poor term that is vague and has existing connotations. People use it to refer to a whole range of different technologies.

However, I struggle to come up with any better terminology. If not 'artificial intelligence', what term would be ideal for describing the capabilities of multi-modal tools like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT?
