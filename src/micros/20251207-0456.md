Had an absolutely fantastic time unicycling in the Perth Christmas Pageant with the WA Historical Cycle Club yesterday evening.

It was tricky riding so slow and in the presence of so many penny-farthings, but we made it through successfully, and everyone had a good time.

I high-fived so many people. I did feel a tad terrible when there were kids I missed or couldn't quite reach down to, though. Lots and lots of tiny hands. The crowd rather liked it when I did little circles.

While most kids were wishing us a merry Christmas, the sheer number of children saying [6-7](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-7_(meme)>) complete with hand gestures was impressive -- like some sort of hive mind.

I was absolutely knackered afterwards but posed for a few photos and such. Had an absolute blast and got to see some TV personalities. A highlight was ex-Wiggle Emma Watkins (Emma Memma) throwing us a compliment, which was lovely.
