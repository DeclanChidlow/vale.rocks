Sorry for being MIA these past few days. Russia and Turkey both banned Discord, so I've been tied up with Revolt. We've had some 250K users join in the past 4 days, bringing us to over 450K users total!

If you aren't aware, Revolt is a FOSS chat platform and decent alternative to Discord that I work on.

You can check it out at <https://revolt.chat> if you're interested.
