I just shaved my head down to bald again. This marks my fourth time doing so, the past three being in aid of the [Leukaemia Foundation](https://www.leukaemia.org.au), for whom I raised a few thousand dollars.

I figured I'd note some of the benefits, especially those I've noticed after some two years since my last haircut.

- Instantly dry after bathing.
- So much cooler temperature-wise.
- Hair stays out of one's face/eyes without the need to tie it up.
- Doesn't get tangled nor require as much care.
- Especially when freshly shaven, extra sensations can be felt. I had an old maths teacher who swore he could forecast the weather, but more realistically, being able to feel air vortexes when walking through doors can be expected.
- In the same vein as the previous, a shower stream on a freshly shaved head feels orgasmic.

Of course, there are also downsides.

- There is social stigma surrounding being bald, especially for men who might be made fun of for male pattern baldness, though I've copped a fair few undesired comments as a teenager.
- It is horrifically easy to be sunburnt.
- Takes effort to maintain.
- Head stubble is surprisingly grippy and can catch on things.
