To the tune of Devo's [Beautiful World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56u6g0POvo0).

It’s a beautiful web we log on to, \
A realm of quiet art-- \
Handcrafted pages and thoughtful words \
Where each voice leaves its mark. \
Makes me want to say...

It’s a beautiful web, \
It’s a beautiful web, \
_It’s a beautiful web_ \
For you, for you, for _you_.

It’s a great time for creation, \
A moment to truly share; \
Mindful code and written dreams \
All built with honest care. \
Makes me want to say...

It’s an uplifting space, \
It’s an uplifting space, \
_It’s an uplifting space_ \
For you, for you, for _you_.

_Hey!_ \
Tell me, what do you see?

Introverts bathed in LCD light, \
Finding meaning in the night. \
_Hey, hey!_

It’s a beautiful web we log on to, \
A realm of quiet art-- \
Handcrafted pages and thoughtful words \
Where each voice leaves its mark. \
Makes me want to say...

It’s a beautiful web, \
It’s a beautiful web, \
_It’s a beautiful web_ \
For you, for you, _for you_.

_It's not for me._

(It's a beautiful web) _For you_ \
(It's a beautiful web) _For you_ \
(It's a beautiful web) _For you_ \
(It's a beautiful web) _Not me--_ \
(It's a beautiful web)...
