I spend quite a bit of money and time doing stuff on the internet, but that isn't necessarily sustainable. So, if you're a fan of me, the stuff I post, the things I've made, or that which I host, then consider supporting me. It helps me keep the servers whirring and the code compiling.

If you're donating for any specific project, then let me know so I can best allocate my resources.
