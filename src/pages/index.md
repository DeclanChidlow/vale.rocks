## Ahoy!

I'm Declan Chidlow; I often go by Vale online, and this site is the gateway to all the horrific abominations I concoct.

I'm a front-end developer with a skew to the front of the front-end. My expertise lies in core web technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – and leveraging them to craft digital experiences that are both functional and visually appealing.

When not bodging together scripts, you may find me cruising around on my unicycle, writing for this website, browsing the crevices of cyberspace, or inadvertently converting an otherwise functional piece of tech into a paperweight.
