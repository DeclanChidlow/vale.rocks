## Ahoy!

I'm Declan Chidlow; I often go by Vale online, and this site is the gateway to all the horrific abominations I concoct.

I'm both a front-end developer and writer. As a developer I have a skew towards the front of the front-end. My expertise lies in core web technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – and leveraging them to craft digital experiences that are both functional and visually appealing. As a writer, I span an assortment of topics, though they are oft technical.

When not bodging together scripts (both the kind you run and the kind you read), you may find me cruising around on unicycle, browsing the crevices of cyberspace, or inadvertently converting an otherwise functional piece of tech into a paperweight.
