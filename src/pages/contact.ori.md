Need to get in contact with me for whatever reason? In order of preference, the best ways to do so are:

- Over electronic mail at <a href="mailto:${ Origami.shell('printenv VALE_EMAIL').trim() }">${ Origami.shell('printenv VALE_EMAIL').trim() }</a>.
- On Stoat as [Vale#0210](https://stoat.chat/qr?v2Zmb3JtYXRqcnFyJHVzZXIkMGZhdmF0YXJ4KmZYdm5WMlp6MmtWMWdTWkMtYm1EaW5NX2ZhSGxkbFVwSzRjZFdaSXdLM2tkaXNwbGF5TmFtZXgaMDFKRFpSREQxWVo4NEhBOEVTVDJFNUdWWFRodXNlcm5hbWVkVmFsZW1kaXNjcmltaW5hdG9yZDAyMTBiaWR4GjAxRzZBMllNSEVEMlRGVEVNTktLTUtGR0gw/w==).
- On Matrix as [@valencethehuman:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@valencethehuman:matrix.org).
- On Bluesky as [@vale.rocks](https://bsky.app/profile/vale.rocks).
- On the Fediverse as [@vale@fedi.vale.rocks](https://fedi.vale.rocks/vale). Please be wary that the privacy of Fediverse DMs is significantly less than other platforms.
- On LinkedIn as [Declan Chidlow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/declan-chidlow/).

Occasionally at my own expense, I do my best to be easily contactable. Please don't take malicious advantage of this.

If you're reaching out to me with purpose, please be forthcoming with your reason(s) for inquiry. Don't just send me a lone 'hello', and don't ask to ask me something -- just ask! I shouldn't have to interrogate you.

I'm a very text-centric person, and I'd prefer you do not try to engage me in a voice or video call without prior scheduling.
