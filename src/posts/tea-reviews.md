Tea is a lovely and extraordinarily varied beverage that I very much enjoy drinking. This post is my attempt to review various teas I've consumed for my future reference.

This post also includes herbal teas and other substances steeped in liquid to extract flavour. I'm aware these aren't technically 'tea' -- that is coming from the _Camellia sinensis_ species -- but don't particularly care about the semantic distinction for the purpose of this post.

I usually use cow's milk where applicable, though also enjoy other options. Soy, almond, and oat being the best I've tried. Oat particularly has a rather pleasant creamy texture. As I find alternative milks are often rather sweet, I will often forgo adding sweeteners when opting for them.

With regard to brewing temperature, I'm not generally too fazed. I don't use boiling water, but beyond that don't take much care. [The impact of water temperature on flavour is small](https://dynomight.net/tea/), and getting temperatures dialled in is bothersome enough that I don't make the effort unless dealing with exemplary tea.

I will note that I am frequently guilty of oversteeping my tea, usually due to getting into the rhythm of a task. For instance, the previous sentence was spurred by the sudden realisation while writing this post that I had neglected my brewing cup of tea and had unintentionally stewed it.

If I'm having a relatively fancy cup of tea, or the context allows/requires it, I do take much more care, but for my casual cup, the effort isn't worth it.

As an aside, I am consistently disappointed by the quality of tea-offering websites. The standard seems to be broken WordPress websites that I feel dubious of entering any payment information into. It seems the more interesting the teas, the worse the websites.

### English Breakfast - Twinings (★★★⯪☆)

_Teabag_

This in my mind is 'tea' -- the definitive article. It isn't anything particularly special but is a safe bet and enjoyable. I usually choose to consume English Breakfast with a teaspoon of sugar.

When I was little, my father took me on a hike down to a little hidden-away secret spot he knew. It was several hours to drive down to the place and several more to hike in.

As such, we woke up early the morning of so we could get down there with time to walk in, and he asked me if I wanted a cup of tea. Because I was young, I very much considered tea an 'adult drink', so I hesitantly said yes.

He gave me a nice hot mug of English Breakfast with lots of sugar and milk, which was lovely and warming in the cold morning. I remember cupping my hands around it for the warmth and sipping from it in front of our house just before we left. My mind always goes back to that moment when I have a cup of English Breakfast with lots of sugar.

### Australian Breakfast - Bushells (★★⯪☆☆)

_Teabag_

This isn't a tea that takes itself seriously. The provided instructions for 'The perfect brew' are quite literally, 'Pour freshly boiled water over a Bushells tea bag', 'Raid the bickie jar as the brew turns rich and dark', and 'Add milk and sugar if you like.' Not even the slightest suggestion of brewing time.

It is casual, accessible, and perfectly drinkable. It isn't anything you'd write home about, but it is nonetheless a pleasant, casual tea. A tad lesser in quality and cost than [Twinings English Breakfast](), but endearing in its own way.

### Australian Afternoon - Twinings (★★★⯪☆)

_Teabag_

A stronger, more defined taste than their English Breakfast, but otherwise quite comparable.

### Arôme Vanille - Bois Chéri (★★★★☆)

_Teabag_

My first experience with a vanilla tea. Upon brewing I was pleasantly surprised by its distinct vanilla scent -- like sniffing a bottle of vanilla extract from a short distance. I'll note that I found it necessary to steep it for 7 minutes or longer, as it is incredibly weak otherwise.

I received this tea for free due to another person's distaste for it, and while I did enjoy it, I would not purchase it of my own volition due to the price and difficulty to acquire. I will pursue more vanilla teas from other providers though.

I must admit that the teabags themselves were poor. They came individually wrapped in paper, but the teabags were often sealed within the paper's crimping, making extraction a difficult process. More than once the string separated from the bag, causing the contents to spill.

### Ceylon Morning Tea - Twinings (★★☆☆☆)

_Teabag_

Twinings tout this as fresh, and I must agree. It has some of the freshness one tastes in peppermint tea.

While refreshing, it isn't my favourite tea. It lacks much note of anything. I can see it as a start to a morning, but only for its slight refreshing notes, not its actual flavour profile.

### Yellow Label - Lipton (★★⯪☆☆)

_Teabag_

Serviceable, but very weak.

## Green

### Pure Green Tea - Twinings (★☆☆☆☆)

_Teabag_

There was green tea buried somewhere in my cup, but it was trapped under some nondescript, unpleasant harshness. It also very much dried out my tongue and throat in a way not dissimilar to having a sore throat while ill.

## Herbal

### Camomile, Honey, and Vanilla - Twinings (★★★☆☆)

_Teabag_

Rather sweet. I fail to taste the artificial vanilla. I opt for this brew when out of milk or wanting to avoid caffeine.

## Masala Chai

Not my favourite type of beverage, though I do enjoy them on occasion.

### Chai Latte - Avalanche (★★★☆☆)

_Sachet_

This was an instant packet offering that I drank warm.

It frothed up nicely while preparing and had a fairly typical chai latte taste. A warm, slightly sweet, and spiced drink that feels smooth while slightly tingly. While the sachet contains milk powder, I chose to top up my mug with a slight amount more, as is my preference. Overall it is a very pleasant and completely non-offensive chai latte.
