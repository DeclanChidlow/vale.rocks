I've posted a few videos showcasing my [subdermal magnet implant](/posts/my-biohacking-experience) to YouTube. The concept of having a magnet implanted in one's hand is decidedly odd, but not too outrageous. My videos are fairly tame, featuring novel showcases such as [turning off my laptop](/videos/laptop-sleep-mode-with-magnet-implant), among other things that aren't adequately conveyed with text.

The YouTube Shorts algorithm picked them up, and they've netted several thousand views from an audience I haven't previously had much interaction with, as I [mainly publish in text](/posts/why-not-video). No doubt the primary audience of brief, visual, and entertaining YouTube Shorts are very different to the audience of the long, informative, and verbose writings I generally publish on this site.

Given this different audience, I've received some interesting comments that I haven't been subject to prior. Most interesting are comments suggesting that my implant is the biblical mark of the beast. One comment read 'you got the mark of the beast microchip implant'. Another read 'La sello de la bestia 666ðŸ˜®' which translates to 'The mark of the beast 666ðŸ˜®' in English. The accounts tied to these comments have genuine-looking activity and don't appear to be trolls.

As someone who is not religious (beyond dabbling with our lord and saviour the Flying Spaghetti Monster and being subjected to a variety of church services and Sunday School 'lessons' as a child), I wasn't entirely familiar with what these comments were referring to. I'm familiar with the concept of the beast and 666 being the devil's number, but my knowledge was by no means extensive. Upon a bit of research online, it seems a huge number of people are of the opinion that subdermal implants are a mark of the beast, citing an extremely old fictional story as a source.

## Biblical Source

The Book of Revelation (or alternatively, Book of the Apocalypse, or Apocalypse of John) is the final book of the Bible's New Testament. It chronicles the appearance of Satan and his bringing about of two beasts. One that rises from the sea and another that rises from the Earth and acts as a false prophet who performs miracles to deceive people into worshipping the first beast. It concludes with Satan, the beasts, and all who bear the mark being defeated when Christ returns. They are thrown into the lake of fire, and God establishes His eternal kingdom for the faithful. To quote the relevant sections:

Revelation 13 verses 15 to 18 say:

> <sup>15</sup> It was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldnâ€™t worship the image of the beast to be killed. <sup>16</sup> He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands or on their foreheads; <sup>17</sup> and that no one would be able to buy or to sell unless he has that mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. <sup>18</sup> Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.

Revelation 14 verse 9 says:

> <sup>9</sup> Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, â€œIf anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,

And Revelation 20 verse 4 says:

> <sup>4</sup> I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and such as didnâ€™t worship the beast nor his image, and didnâ€™t receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

## Analysis

From these verses, we can gauge that the mark of the beast told in the story is located on a person's right hand and/or forehead, and that one is unable to buy or sell without it. It is also suggested that the mark is the name of the beast or the number 666.

I have sourced the above Bible quotes from the World English Bible, but different translations vary between 'on' and 'in' when referring to the placement of the mark. The process by which subdermal implants such as mine are implanted does more often than not leave a scar though, so there is a 'mark' both in and on. Bibles also vary between a mark on one's forehead _and_ right hand, or on one's forehead _or_ their right hand, not just between translations but even sometimes within the same translation.

You may be wondering if, according to the Bible, I am marked by the beast. Probably not, as my magnet does not match any of these criteria. My implant is within my left hand and bears no mark, number, or reference to the beast. It also doesn't have any influence on my ability to pay for things.

It is possible to get implants in your right hand of course and while it is true that there are implants that facilitate payment, they still lack any marking of the beast upon them and aren't always viable thanks to the horrors of payment processors. Given that it is possible for you to write whatever content you'd choose to an RFID implant or the likes, I suppose you could put something relating to the beast, but at that point you're really just asking for the end of days.

In terms of marks on the forehead, they aren't particularly common. Some people do get cosmetic forehead surgery, and some other people get bumps implanted, but neither contains any information, much less information that could constitute a mark of the beast. I'd think people getting forehead tattoos would be a closer analogue, but I digress. If you want to interpret the Bible more vaguely, you can include neural interfaces such as the ones developed by Neuralink and Starfish Neuroscience, though they are incredibly limited in capabilities, extremely uncommon, and usually placed further back on the skull.

To be clear, I'm against privacy-eroding mass surveillance, microchips or not. That said, microchips are not a good tracking tool. Even at super close proximities (skin touching reader) under ideal conditions it can be iffy to get a good reading from them. Any which way, implants such as mine have been implanted in people, pets, and wildlife for years, and I'm yet to be thrown into a lake of fire.

In summary, I don't have the mark of the beast, and neither does anyone else. If you think that you've been implanted with a microchip against your will, I'd recommend reading [this advisory from Dangerous Things](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/so-you-think-youve-been-implanted-against-your-will/64).
