I love words and the English language [^1] happens to have lots of them. My favourites tend to be overly specific, fun to say, or just a tad zany. Many words in this list are homonyms or polysemous, but I am only including my favourite definitions unless there is reason not to.

The extremely savvy reader could perhaps surmise what media I have been consuming, particularly what books I've been reading, based on the order of certain words outlined here or the mere occurrence of some of the more obscure inclusions.
