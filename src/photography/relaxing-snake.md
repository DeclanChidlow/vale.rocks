This snake's name is George, and while feeding him, he took preference to my hand rather than the large dead mouse we'd defrosted for him. Once he had his jaws agape and fangs digging into my left hand's hypothenar eminence, he held on for a while before eventually being pried free. Thankfully he is a python, so there was no poison involved. His bite didn't particularly hurt either.
