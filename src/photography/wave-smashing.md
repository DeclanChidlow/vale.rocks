description: Waves smashing around a rock at a beach.
alt_text: A picture of the ocean at a beach. In the foreground are some vibrant shallows interspersed with rocks. The water is so clear and colourful it is almost green in places. Just right of the centre is a large rock being smashed from behind by water, sending a wave up into the air. In the background is a very clear blue sky.
