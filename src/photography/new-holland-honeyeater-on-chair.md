My mother and I went to [The Berry Farm](https://theberryfarm.com.au) which was swarming with New Holland Honeyeaters and Blue Wrens. As we sat at the cafe, the birds would dive down to steal people's berry jams if they left them unattended for even the briefest of moments.

I managed to take this picture as a bird 'sat' on the chair at the end of our table.
