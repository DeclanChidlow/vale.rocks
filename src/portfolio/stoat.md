[Stoat](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat_(software)>) is an open-source, user-first chat application, similar in functionality to Discord or Slack. During my time with the project, I have helped scale it from less than 100K users to over a million.

Stoat may have grown substantially, and commitments mean that the exact number of core team members fluctuates, but the count has remained under 10 members. As a result, I've worn many hats and taken the title of 'Doer of Assorted Things'.

I've maintained the repository for client themes, written extensive documentation, built the [Mutant Remix website](/portfolio/mutant-remix), developed and maintained the resources required for self-hosting, handled countless support tickets, addressed innumerable user moderation reports, [handled security events](https://wiki.revolt.chat/notes/transparency/incidents/2025-05-08-attempted-extortion/), created brand resources, overseen internationalisation efforts, and of course implemented new front-end features.

During user influxes, people join en masse -- sometimes to the order of hundreds of thousands over just a few days. During these periods I've gone to great and significant lengths to keep the platform in a usable state by manually handling systems struggling under the scale. During a significant influx in February 2026, I handled thousands of user queries via email, Bluesky, Reddit, and Stoat itself over a hectic period of a few days.

Separate from my duties as a Stoat team member, I have also created one of the most popular bots on the platform, [AutoMod](/portfolio/automod), which helps community owners to ensure a safe space for all.

## Icon

In October 2025, Stoat [rebranded from its previous name of Revolt](https://stoat.chat/updates/long-live-stoat), which came with the need for new branding. I began experimenting and ideating with a stylised vector stoat.

Given the platform's name, modelling the icon on the visage of the mustelid was the obvious choice. Initially starting with a sharp, polygonal look, feedback from one of Stoat's founders pushed the design into a smoother, curvier appearance on which I iterated. The challenge lay in achieving a simple, scalable graphic that was distinctly a stoat and didn't stray into the territory of otter, ferret, or other mustelid.

Placing users first has always been a core tenet of Stoat, so it was only right that I developed the icon publicly by sharing my progress on-platform with various users providing their feedback and opinions along the way. Not all feedback was good feedback, and with a general audience not all folks are designers or able to articulate their thoughts, but I believe consulting the community to be paramount in designing an icon to represent the platform that houses said community.

            <desc>A minimalist three-quarter view portrait of a stoat's head and neck. The design uses smooth, flowing curves and negative space to define the jawline and neck. Key features include two pointed ears, dots for the eyes, and a prominent nose, giving it a defined appearance. It is clean and professional but has an almost derpy expression.</desc>

I'm incredibly pleased with how the icon turned out and how it has been integrated into the platform's brand. The Stoat community [proved to love the new icon](https://bsky.app/profile/stoat.chat/post/3memon3azgk22) and even gave them a name, 'Toast'!
