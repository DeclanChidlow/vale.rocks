I'm near certain that most people, at some point, have fantasised about wielding meat as a writing tool. Well, you needn't wait any longer, as my Osseo Flesh fulfils that dream.

While studying design, I received the brief of creating a typeface. As long as it had the entire alphabet, both upper and lowercase, anything went. I tested a few considerations, including singed paper, before settling on making a "meat font".

For a few fleeting moments, I considered using actual meat but thought better and instead took it as a wonderful opportunity to test Adobe Illustrator's 3D tools. Using some interesting texturing, I managed to concoct a fleshy, meaty typeface.

While cool, this wasn't fit for any actual use, so I pivoted to keeping things flat and pushing boundries with variable axes, inspired by the typeface [Climate Crisis](https://design.google/library/glacial-melt-font).
