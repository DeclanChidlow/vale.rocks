I'm by no means a professional photographer, but these are a series of photos I’ve taken. I don’t have a professional camera, so I use my Nokia G22’s inbuilt camera and then touch them up, where necessary, in Adobe Lightroom. I enjoy taking pictures of the natural world when the opportunity presents itself, although I’m far from opposed to taking pictures of other subjects.

I upload most of what I take to Unsplash for anyone to use, free of charge. My account is [@OuterVale](https://unsplash.com/@outervale).

The vibrant blue lake is prominent, with boats visible on the water, and the settlement spreads out into the green and brown patchwork landscape leading to the towering peaks under a clear blue sky." />
