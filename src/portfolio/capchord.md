CapChord is my business that has taken on various purposes throughout the years.

## Captioning

CapChord started out offering closed captioning services for web content. This is the origin of its name, being a blend of caption and chord[^1]. Though the sudden jump in publicly available AI offerings eventually made this non-viable on a small scale.

## Tech Support

Following the winding down of captioning services, CapChord pivoted to mobile call-out support dedicated to helping the elderly and those with limited technical knowledge by providing support with a range of digital tasks.

This face-to-face support was vital in helping me learn how to liaise with clients and how to act in a professional environment. I picked up on issues such as some clients needing not just help but a full explanation of what I was doing and how I was doing it to assist them in understanding their own technology. This led me to tailor my operation to explaining and teaching as well as troubleshooting and fixing in a way that is both efficient and effective.

## Next

Now CapChord is switching things up and expanding onto its next frontier.

[^1]: A chord is an action made when typing on a stenotype. It's somewhat equivalent to pressing a key on a keyboard, though that is a gross oversimplification.
