During my Diploma of Information Technology (Frontend Development), I worked within a team on a website for Public Libraries Western Australia (PLWA) -- a not-for-profit organisation advocating for public libraries across the state. They collaborate with local and state governments, as well as a range of national organisations.

We worked on the redevelopment of PLWAâ€™s website, which was originally created in 2009 using now ancient versions of Joomla and Bootstrap. It was outdated, broken in places, vulnerable to security risks, and lacked adequate support from its previous hosting provider. Our team, which included [Emily Drage](https://emilydrage.com), [Zoe Chan](https://zoecchan.me), and Maria Benic, took on the challenge of modernising their online presence.

We started with in-depth client consultations, moving from wireframes to **Figma** prototypes. Through multiple rounds of client feedback and user testing, we iteratively refined our designs, addressing flaws to ensure a user-centric approach.

The natural choice for this content-driven site, which would be managed by non-technical staff, was **WordPress**. We built the theme from the ground up, embracing WordPress's **block theme** functionality and using **Tailwind CSS** for design consistency and efficient collaboration. I specifically developed a custom **WordPress plugin** to handle custom post types for news, events, and workshops, ensuring the site could effectively fit PLWA's needs.

We successfully modernised the user experience, made it secure and performant, and hugely **improved SEO** along the way, allowing better online visibility. The new flexibility allotted by our full redesign and development allows for new content to be written and published in a much easier flow and in many different forms.

We delivered **comprehensive documentation** for both technical setup and ongoing content management. While every project involves some compromises, the client was ultimately pleased with the final outcome, and we successfully achieved their goals for a revitalised and functional website.
