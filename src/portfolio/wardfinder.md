Wardfinder was a startup intending to improve navigation through indoor medical facilities. Think Google Maps, but for finding your way around hospitals.

As the sole developer on the project, I assessed a number of technologies for stability and performed testing of each while working closely with the founder to brainstorm, define, and refine project ideas and feature requirements.

Where GPS generally works admirably for navigation, multistory medical spaces filled with interfering equipment can't be navigated using traditional systems.

Instead, I developed custom checkpoint-based systems and explored options including Bluetooth beacons and Wi-Fi network-based triangulation.

Accessibility is _always_ a primary consideration in any work, but in the context of those seeking medical assistance, it becomes further imperative. Not only because there is a higher number of disabled individuals attending medical facilities, but also because of the potentially stressful or confronting context of a visit to a medical facility. Ease, efficiency, and care for users was paramount.

I assisted in the design phase using **Figma** before moving on to building applications with **React**, **React Native (via Expo)**, and **PHP** to target a wide target audience of end users and potential specialised devices.

A core part of my involvement with the project was ensuring that we could have quick, iterable demonstrations that were implemented in such a way that they could be swiftly scaled up without incurring significant overhead.

This role allowed me to hone my skills in web development and API integrations, as well as gain some experience building a native, cross-platform application.
