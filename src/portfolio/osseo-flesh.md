I'm near certain that most people, at some point, have fantasised about wielding meat as a writing tool. Well, you needn't wait any longer, as my Osseo Flesh fulfils that dream.

While studying design, I received the brief of creating a typeface. As long as it had the entire alphabet, both upper and lowercase, anything went. I tested a few considerations, including singed paper, before settling on making a "meat font".

For a few fleeting moments, I considered using actual meat but thought better of it and instead took it as a wonderful opportunity to test Adobe Illustrator's 3D tools. Using some interesting texturing, I managed to concoct a fleshy, meaty typeface.

While cool, this wasn't fit for any actual use, so I pivoted to keeping things flat and pushing boundaries with variable axes, inspired by the typeface [Climate Crisis](https://design.google/library/glacial-melt-font).

The variable axis allows for controlling the amount of meat, skin, and sinews that cover the core bone. The underlying bone type is unaffected by this for the purpose of keeping legibility at every point.
