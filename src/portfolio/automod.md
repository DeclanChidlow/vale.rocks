AutoMod is a moderation bot for the chat platform [Revolt](https://revolt.chat), of which I am a core team member. It is one of the most popular, bots on the platform being present in some 4600 servers with a total user count of some 100K users.

I develop, maintain, and host the bot for public usage on the official Revolt instance. It provides commands that make it easy to filter messages, take punitive actions on users, and log actions, among much more.

All of the bot's details and comprehensive documentation are available on [the website I built and constructed for it](https://automod.vale.rocks).

The project is open source under the AGPL v3, with all the source code and documentation being [available on GitHub](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/AutoMod). Contributions are welcome.
