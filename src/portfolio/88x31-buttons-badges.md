Emerging in the mid-90s, badges/buttons with a resolution of 88 pixels by 31 pixels spread through the web like wildfire before eventually waning in popularity in the 2000s.

A sure remnant of the olden days of the web, today they have a retro chic. They're a fun, lo-fi visual adornment, so I took it upon myself to design some modern buttons/badges adhering to the limitations of the time. I'm always looking to improve and refine my skills, and a restraint such as a canvas of a mere 2728 pixels proved a great opportunity.

Here is a badge I created to represent this site:

<img src="/assets/buttons/valerocks_button.avif" alt="'Vale.Rocks' badge.">

I've taken the creation of these badges as an opportunity to experiment and thus covered a range of topics and material. It proves difficult to represent a complex or meaningful idea in such a small amount of space.

## Ideology

A core part of any personal website, which is where such badges are most likely to be seen, is to represent one's own thoughts, stances, and ideologies.

<div class="buttons-badges">
<img src="/assets/buttons/anti-fascism_button.gif" alt="'No Fascism / No Bigotry' badge with crossed-out swastika.">
<img src="/assets/buttons/link-freely_button.gif" alt="'Link Freely' badge with chain links.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/ideological/melt-ice_button.gif" alt="'Melt Ice' badge.">
</div>

## Tech

Another common use for badges and buttons is to show off technologies in use. Sharing openly how things are built and what technologies are used led to a strong natural discovery and a natural onboarding for people building their own websites.

<div class="buttons-badges">
<img src="/assets/buttons/web-origami_button.gif" alt="'Built with Origami' badge.">
<img src="/assets/buttons/html5_button.gif" alt="'Hypertext Markup Language' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/html_button.gif" alt="'&#60;HTML/&#62;' badge.">
<img src="/assets/buttons/made-with-css_button.gif" alt="'Made with Cascading Stylesheets' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/css_button.gif" alt="'.CSS {}' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/css-passion_button.gif" alt="'CSS is my passion' badge with text overflowing the badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/tailwind_button.gif" alt="'Tailwind' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/bootstrap_button.gif" alt="'Bootstrap' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/css-greater-js_button.gif" alt="'CSS &#62; JS' badge.">

<img src="/assets/buttons/ecmascript_button.gif" alt="'Contains ECMAScript' badge with exclamation points.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/js_button.gif" alt="'JS()' badge.">
<img src="/assets/buttons/progressively-enhanced_button.gif" alt="Rainbow 'Progressively Enhanced' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/tech/markdown_button.gif" alt="'# MD' badge.">
</div>

## Platforms

Online platforms have become a large part of people's lives, even if they may conflict somewhat with many of the ideals of the sort of person that uses 88x31 buttons/badges. As part of making the web as a whole an interlinked place, I made a range of badges for popular platforms.

<div class="buttons-badges">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/platforms/bluesky_button.gif" alt="'Bluesky' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/platforms/codeberg_button.gif" alt="'Codeberg' badge.">
<img src="https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/88x31-Buttons-Badges/raw/refs/heads/main/platforms/gitlab_button.gif" alt="'GitLab' badge.">
</div>
