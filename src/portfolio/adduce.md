After experimenting with some popular static site generators, I found myself wanting something a bit different -- a tad more conducive to my workflow. So, I figured I'd try making one myself.

> [!NOTE]
> For the unfamiliar, a static site generator is a tool that compiles web pages in advance rather than on the fly when a user loads up a site. This helps create pages that are quick to load and simple to host.

I mentioned my intentions to my friend [ToastXC](https://toastxc.xyz), who implemented the initial groundwork in her language of choice, Rust, before stepping away from the project.

Being a front-end dev, Rust isn't my area of expertise. Nevertheless, I've embraced my inexperience as an opportunity to expand my skill set and push the boundaries of my knowledge.

Through working on Adduce, I've gained invaluable experience and insights. Despite my initial unfamiliarity, I've successfully maintained the project and implemented new features, with much more planned for the future.

As I've built this site and others using Adduce, I'm consistently tweaking and improving it. I also put together a [landing page for the project](https://adduce.vale.rocks) with links to the [comprehensive documentation](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/Adduce/wiki) I've written.

The project is completely open source under the LGPL v3, with all the source code and documentation being [available on GitHub](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/Adduce). Contributions are welcome.
