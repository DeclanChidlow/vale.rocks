title: Pam Carter's Scriptural Poetry
---

My grandmother, Pamela Maitland Carter, has been writing poetry for decades. Leveraging my design knowledge and extensive experience with software such as Adobe's Creative Cloud, I compiled many of these poems into a four volume set.

The books contain a mixture of stock photos, photography taken by myself, and remastered photos from the family archives (in some cases meticulously colourised) .

The books feature a combination of stock photos, [my own photography](/portfolio/photography), and family archive images. Some of these archival photos have been meticulously colourized, while others 'merely' needed restoration.

Beyond crafting a polished set of books, the entire process proved an excellent opportunity to broaden my knowledge of press publication and design for physical mediums.

If you'd like a copy, the whole set is [available to purchase on Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CW1B4V2M).
