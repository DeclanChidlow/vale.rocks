My grandmother, Pamela Maitland Carter, has been writing poetry for decades. Leveraging my design knowledge and extensive experience with software such as Adobe's Creative Cloud, I compiled many of these poems into a four-volume set of print books.

Designing around poetry was a challenging task, as poems place much more emphasis on typesetting than standard prose. Poems have specific line breaks and spacing, non-standard alignments, variable line lengths, and a range of other typographical and layout considerations that are pushed to the forefront given the often minimal text content.

The books feature a combination of stock photos, [my own photography](/photography), and scanned family archive images where relevant. Many of these archival photos were in black and white, so I had to meticulously colourise them. Others were extremely old and stored in poor conditions, which required me to laboriously restore them to presentable states.

Beyond crafting a polished set of books, the entire process proved an excellent opportunity to broaden my knowledge of print publication and design for physical mediums -- something I had sorely been lacking.

If you'd like to own a copy for yourself, the whole set is [available to purchase on Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CW1B4V2M).
