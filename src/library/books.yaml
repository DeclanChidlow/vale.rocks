- title: The Elements of Style
  authors: William Strunk Jr, EB White
  rating: 4
  notes: A useful book which in some places shows its age. I would recommend it to all writers, if not just to find which parts you disagree with so as to form strong opinions of your own.

- title: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
  authors: Eliezer Yudkowsky
  notes: |
    Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is certainly a long and difficult read, with some rather questionable parts, but some interesting ideas which can be extracted. It has its flaws, and certain bits are contrived, but overall it's quite a worthy experience.
    I haven't read much fan fiction, but this feels more transformative than the usual. The world is much the same, as are the character names, but their behaviours and the overall approach to everything is almost completely unique.
    Towards the beginning of the book, I had several issues with it. Rather impressively, almost every gripe turned out to be intentional and was either addressed or resolved by the end.
