- title: Practical Typography
  release_year: 2013
  authors: Matthew Butterick
  notes: Very opinionated and aimed more at the amateur typographer than someone with professional experience, but nevertheless valuable. I disagree with certain assertions, such as the notion of not underlining links.

- title: Careless People
  release_year: 2025
  authors: Sarah Wynn-Williams
  notes: I really struggled to read this, as the content was so repulsive in a way that I've never experienced in any other context other than cringe. Through particularly slimy portions my skin felt tight on me, and I regularly had to put it down and take a break. Any one of the many horrific cases this book details should have been enough to destroy the company. I couldn't keep myself from drawing comparisons to Friendship is Optimal. Everyone will live in the Facebook world in which all their desires will be met, and they will be happy.

  release_year: 1959
  authors: William Strunk Jr, EB White
  rating: 4
  notes: A useful book which in some places shows its age. I would recommend it to all writers, if not just to find which parts you disagree with so as to form strong opinions of your own.

- title: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
  release_year: 2015
  authors: Eliezer Yudkowsky
  notes: |
    Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is certainly a long and difficult read, with some rather questionable parts, but some interesting ideas which can be extracted. It has its flaws, and certain bits are contrived, but overall it's quite a worthy experience.
    I haven't read much fan fiction, but this feels more transformative than the usual. The world is much the same, as are the character names, but their behaviours and the overall approach to everything is almost completely unique.
    Towards the beginning of the book, I had several issues with it. Rather impressively, almost every gripe turned out to be intentional and was either addressed or resolved by the end.
