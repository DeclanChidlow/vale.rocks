  release_year: 2006
  rating: 4
  notes: Dexter is an enjoyable show if you turn your brain off, but even with a brain disabled it begins to completely unravel during seasons six and is little more than a frayed mass by season eight. It is a shame, as I found the first five seasons to be quite engaging.

- title: Cowboy Bebop
  release_year: 1998
  rating: 4.5
  notes: Jazz, spaceships, outcasts, and worlds not too unlike our own. I have a preference for the more serious, complex episodes, and I unfortunately find the characterisation fluctuates a tad, but Bebop is still brilliant. I can largely credit the series for my interest in jazz. So long, space cowboy.

          notes: Watched subbed. I think I might genuinely prefer the dubbed version though, in a departure from my usual preference. This watch through had much more impact on me then my initial one.
