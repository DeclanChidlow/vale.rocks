- title: Dexter
  release_year: 2006
  notes: Dexter is an enjoyable show if you turn your brain off, but even with a brain disabled it begins to completely unravel during seasons six and is little more than a frayed mass by season eight. It is a shame, as I found the first five seasons to be quite engaging.
