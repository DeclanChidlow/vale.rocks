  notes: The first half felt a tad weak due to the psychological aspects not being properly explored as a result of the constant comedic relief breaking tension. It strengthened greatly in the last quarter. Overall, I feel it could have leaned a little bit more into the incoherency of dreams, rather than just the surrealism.
