  notes: Not quite as sharp as the originals. What made Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker brilliant was the sheer number of layered jokes that are so numerous that even after several watches you continue to discover new ones. I feel like I've experienced all this film has to offer in the first watch, and that each of the jokes felt added on, rather than inline and spur of the moment. They were almost skits, rather than quick visual gags or witty turns of phrase that you take a moment to process before chuckling.

  notes: Too long and extremely poorly paced. The action sequences were exhilarating, and the visuals were great, but the story was sloppy. Generically named malevolent AI that gains sentience and tries to destroy the world is a plot that has been done to death. The action scenes were slightly marred due to the characters being seemingly invincible and thus the risks being nullified. One can only suspend their disbelief so much in a film that is attempting to remain based in reality.

  notes: As a fan of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Darkman has a lot of the same stylistic hallmarks, although as yet unrefined. I'm unsure if it was supposed to be quite as funny as I found it, but I really enjoyed it in a schlock sense.

  notes: A fantastic satire, though it is a shame that private enterprise meddling in public services and police brutality have remained such relevant topics. The stop-motion and practical effects are fantastic. Where many films present an 80s version of the future, RoboCop feels like the future brought back to the 80s.
