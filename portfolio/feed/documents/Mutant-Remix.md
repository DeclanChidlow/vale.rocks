Mutant Remix is an emoji pack built for the chat platform [Revolt](/blog/Revolt_Promotion). It combines the blobby shapes of Android's emojis of old with the crisp, bold style of Mutant Standard, creating something new and distinct.

I was tasked with building a website for the platform. A previous contributor already had a design in mind, which I fleshed out, cleaned up, and put to code. I used my static site generator, [Adduce](https://adduce.vale.rocks) and put together a site that introduces people to the project.

You can check out the live site at [mutant.revolt.chat](https://mutant.revolt.chat).
