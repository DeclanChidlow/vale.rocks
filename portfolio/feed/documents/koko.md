I, like many others, am quite a fan of chocolate. That's why I was very happy when I got the brief while completing my Certificate IV in Design to create a branding system and some packaging for a fictional Margret River business by the name of Koko Chocolate Crafters.

The target audience for the business was primarily female chocolate lovers over the age of 30, so I tailored my packaging while designing it. The challenge lay in creating a visual identity that exuded both luxury and approachability.

I designed the brand to appear premium and entice users in a way that spoke directly to the refined tastes of the mature audience while ensuring an inclusive appeal.

Once I had the brand system established, I got to work on the packaging. I created three designs, one for each of the three launch flavours, and I'm very happy with the end result. It blends premium appeal with the lure of a delicious taste.
