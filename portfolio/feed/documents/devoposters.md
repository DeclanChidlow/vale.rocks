Devo is a band I've been a fan of ever since I was very young. Dancing along to "Whip It!" on my MP3 player, hearing their scores for films and games, and seeing Mark Mothersbaugh on Yo Gabba Gabba are all etched into my brain.

When I was tasked with making a set of posters for a band of my choosing while studying for my Cert IV in Graphic Design, it was a no brainer to choose them. Their distinct style and captivating visuals offered the perfect canvas to showcase my skills and pay homage to a band that has been a significant inspiration.

The brief was to create three posters, each taking inspiration from the colours and styles of a specific decade. I chose to represent the 1920s, 1960s, and 2000s. I researched each era and built up a palette for my posters.

For my 1920s poster, I selected the era's more muted, warmer colours, tapping into the sepia toned elegance of the past. My geometric, stylized silhouettes attempted to echo the modernist approach of the time.

In contrast, my 1960s poster leaned into more psychedelic, vivid colours, capturing the free-spirited essence of the era. The palette and overall design take much inspiration from Arnold Skolnick's 1969 Woodstock poster.

My 2000s design was perhaps the most open in terms of palette. Being the era where digital technologies really took hold, there was a full digital palette at my disposal. I chose the bright, sometimes garish, colour palettes of the Frutiger Metro aesthetic.

With each poster, I made an earnest attempt to not only capture the colours but also celebrate the artistic evolution and technological advancements that defined each period.
