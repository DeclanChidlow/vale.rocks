The brief I received for this student project was to create album artwork for a fictitious band of my creation. I came up with Neon Delta, an embodiment of indie synthwave vibes.

I've always felt that synthwave has a very futuristic yet 80s feel to it. It's as if it presents the analogue future that never materialised. I've always found that, within this genre, there is a slight dystopian undertone. I set out to encapsulate that in my album art.

There were a few ways to go about representing it that I attempted. I took a picture of my music visualizer, which promptly corrupted, leaving me with what I thought was a really striking effect. I also tried to represent sound waves by layering undulating blocks, but neither of these quite achieved what I had envisioned.

The blocks are in an assortment of colors against a dark background. The album's title is written in white block letters." />

Ultimately, I found success in imitating a wood grain hi-fi system with a large oscilloscope embedded, featuring the album name. I tied in the dystopian elements I had been aiming for by transforming it into a slightly militaristic apparatus, adorned with an array of purposeful buttons. This captured exactly the style I was striving for, and with a bit of refinement, became my final product.

The left side of the image depicts a stylized vintage control panel with a green oscilloscope screen and knobs, and buttons that include a red 'NUKE' button. Below it reads 'Exercise complete caution when operating device.' The right side features the actual vinyl record with grooves and the album's title printed near the center. The background has a wooden texture, blending the old-fashioned control equipment aesthetic with the timeless vinyl record." />
