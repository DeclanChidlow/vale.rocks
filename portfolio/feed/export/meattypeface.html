    Slightly Disturbing Typeface

		Meat Typeface
	</h1>
</header>
<p>I'm near certain that most people, at some point, have fantasised about wielding meat as a writing tool. Well, you needn't wait any longer, as my meat typeface fulfils that dream.</p>
<p>The brief I received during my Certificate IV in Design was to create a typeface. As long as it had the entire alphabet, both upper and lowercase, anything went. I thought long and hard before settling on meat.</p>
<p>For a fleeting moment, I considered using actual meat but thought better and instead took it as a wonderful opportunity to learn about Adobe Illustratorâ€™s 3D tools. Using some interesting texturing, I managed to concoct a fleshy, meaty typeface.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about letter forms during the process and ended up spending a lot of time waiting for Illustrator to compute my 3D shapes. I think it was worth it in the end, as the output was certainly <em>interesting</em>.</p>
