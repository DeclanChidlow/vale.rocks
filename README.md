Personal website of Declan Chidlow
</div>
<br/>

A website full of the trials and tribulations of Declan Chidlow. You can view the site live at [vale.rocks](https://vale.rocks).

> [!NOTE]
> I don't accept pull requests on this repository as it is a personal project. However, you are welcome to open [issues](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/vale.rocks/issues) where necessary.

This site is built using my static site generator, [Adduce](adduce.vale.rocks). I build Adduce alongside my site, so the public build of Adduce is not always guaranteed to work as expected with this site.

## Generating

The site can be conveniently generated with the [`gen.sh`](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/vale.rocks/blob/main/gen.sh) script. This script will need editing whenever new pages are added to the site. Currently, the site is hosted using GitHub Pages, so the script is configured to output the built site to the `/docs` folder within the repository for easy deployment.
