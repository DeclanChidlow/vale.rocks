A website full of the trials and tribulations of Declan Chidlow. You can view the site live at [vale.rocks](https://vale.rocks).

This site was created with [Adduce](https://adduce.vale.rocks), a static site generator created by a friend and myself. It uses both the standard and feed functionality in tandem for a full blog experience. You can read more about how this is achieved at the bottom of [this](https://vale.rocks/blog/Welcome) post.

### Building
To build the site you can run `sh gen.sh`. The `gen.sh` file will need editing whenever adding new pages to the site. It will output the site to the `docs/` folder so it can be easily published using Github Pages.
